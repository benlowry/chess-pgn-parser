{This is one of Tal's most famous games. It was played against Gurgenidze in
the 1957 Soviet Championship. This was of course one of the strongest
tournaments in the world at that time and all contestants were among the
finest players at that time. Despite this, Tal rolled through his opponent in
this game. He supposedly said that the first thing he looks for in any
position is if he can sacrifice his queen. After seeing games like this I want
to believe him.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 {[%cal Rd5c6]} e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5

the Benoni often fight over the d7 square. I like the idea of black playing
Bg4 here to eliminate one of black's clumsy pieces.} Re8 {[%cal Ye8e4]} (9...

a bit too congested on the queenside to realistically expect black to be able

this could be considered a more modern way to approach this variation. Black
doesn't have a clear way to continue knocking on the white center here. In
positions like this sometimes black will play g5 and play on the dark-squares
but of course this is somewhat weakening.}) 13... Ng4 14. h3 $4 {Tal also
jokingly stated that when he learned chess, he learned that knights don't move
backwards. I really have to wonder what Gurgenidze was thinking here. To
provoke Tal into a sacrifice such as the one played in the game is a crazy
decision.} (14. Bxg4 $1 {This was absolutely the best course of action here.

why. An awesome game! Tal knew exactly when it was time to improve his pieces
