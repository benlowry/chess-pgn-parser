{Ding Liren is world class player who is typically seen as a solid but very
strong player, however in this game he shows off an incredible imagination.
His opponent is a fellow countrymen who made GM at just the age of sixteen.} 1.
d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 {This is the Nimzo-Indian defense. It's very popular at the
highest levels. At one point this was considered a hypermodern defense because
it puts no pawns in the center immediately. Gradually though, it has become
clear that there is a very strong positional foundation here for black. They
are still controlling the center and will be able to counterstrike the center
with the pawn break of their choice, once they are ready.} 3. Nc3 (3. Nf3 {
This is a very popular move which can head back towards the Queen's Gambit
Declined, or into a new opening, the Queen's Indian.} b6 {[%csl Gb7,Ge4][%cal
Gc8b7,Gb7e4] This is the Queen's Indian.} (3... d5 {This is also a good option
for black. Now white cannot play the Exchange variation, which is typically
seen as one of the best challenges to the QGD.})) 3... Bb4 {[%cal Rb4e1]} 4.
Nf3 {After the game, Ding Liren said that his opponent is a very well prepared
player with a lot of ideas in the opening. He expected Jinshi to be playing
for a win here.} (4. Qc2 {This is a more positional approach. White will
usually aim to grab the bishop pair with this variation.} O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6.
Qxc3) (4. f3 {This is a very aggressive approach. White hopes to expand the
center as much as possible. The gained space can often lead to kingside
attacks.}) 4... O-O (4... b6 {[%csl Ge4][%cal Gc8b7,Gb7e4] This is also a good
move. Black fights for control of the e4-square using their bishop on b7.}) 5.
Bg5 {[%cal Rg5d8]} c5 6. e3 cxd4 (6... h6 7. Bh4 cxd4 8. Qxd4 Nc6 9. Qd3 {
This would tranpose to the game.}) 7. Qxd4 $1 (7. exd4 d5 $1 {Black gets good
play in the center.}) 7... Nc6 8. Qd3 h6 9. Bh4 d5 $1 10. Rd1 g5 $1 {This
always requires very careful judgment, and here Ding's judgment is correct.
Black will get good counterplay in the center now that the f6 knight can move.}
11. Bg3 Ne4 {[%csl Rc3][%cal Rb4e1,Re4c3]} (11... Qa5 $1 {This is good now as
well as the next turn.}) 12. Nd2 Nc5 $5 {This leads to massive complications.}
(12... Qa5 $5) 13. Qc2 d4 $1 14. Nf3 $1 {[%cal Rd1d8]} e5 $1 {[%csl Gc8][%cal
Gc8g4,Ge5d4] Black must commit to the attack here or else their center will
collapse. Generally speaking, it is also very principled to try to open up the
center when the opponent's king is not castled.} 15. Nxe5 (15. Bxe5 $1 {
This would have allowed white to keep more control of the game, but black
would still have good compensation after the following sequence...} Nxe5 16.
Nxe5 Qf6 17. exd4 Bf5 18. Qd2 Ne6 $44) 15... dxc3 $1 16. Rxd8 cxb2+ {[%cal
Gb4e1]} 17. Ke2 $2 {[%csl Re2]} (17. Rd2 $1 {White must play this move,
otherwise face a devastating attack. As is often times the case, white can
survive the attack by sacrificing back the extra material to weather the storm.
The game could reach an even endgame after this sensible sequence...} Rd8 18.

Rd4c2,Rd4f3] Wow!! What a move! Black now threatens g4 with mate coming.} (
20... h5 {This could lead to the game continuation if white plays h3.}) (20...
Rd6 $5 {This is also a good idea but definitely not as strong as the game move.

because White can runaway with the king, and black will have to deal with the
d4 rook being under attack.} 24. Kf4 $1 {[%csl Rd4]} Rd2 25. Qxe4 Rxf2+ 26. Kg5

ended here although a beautiful outcome would have been 34. Kh4 Kg8 35. Nxh8
