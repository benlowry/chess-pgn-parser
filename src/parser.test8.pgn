{Rubinstein is arguably the best if not one of the best of players to never
become world champion. He was known as a master technician but in this game he
plays an incredible series of sacrifices, resulting in his "Immortal Game."} 1.
d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 c5 4. c4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 {Incredibly, this rather boring
symmetrical position results in fireworks later in the game. With a few
inaccuracies throughout the middlegame, Rotlewi falls behind and overextends.}
6. dxc5 {This is not the most consistent move with play so far.} (6. a3 {
White could play this now as well with a potential transposition to the game.}
a6 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. b4 {White wants to expand on the queenside and fianchetto
to b2.}) 6... Bxc5 7. a3 {[%cal Gb2b4,Gb4c5,Gc1b2]} a6 8. b4 Bd6 (8... Ba7) 9.
Bb2 O-O 10. Qd2 $6 (10. cxd5 exd5 {[%cal Rc3d5,Rd1d5,Yf6d5,Yd8d5]} 11. Nxd5 $4
(11. Be2 $1 {This was white's best bet towards fighting for the advantage. At
least he is not on the wrong side of a symmetrical position here.}) 11... Nxd5
12. Qxd5 $4 {[%csl Rd5][%cal Rd8d5]} Bxb4+ $1 13. axb4 (13. Qd2 Bxd2+) 13...
Qxd5) (10. Be2 {White hesitated with this move because he didn't want to lose
time moving this light-squared bishop twice. In reality though, he ended up
playing waiting moves that did not help his cause either and just ends up
falling farther behind in development.} dxc4 $1 11. Bxc4 b5 $1 12. Bd3 Bb7 {
Black is now playing the white side of a symmetrical position due to the extra
tempo!}) 10... Qe7 11. Bd3 (11. cxd5 exd5 12. Nxd5 Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Rd8 {[%cal
Rd8d5,Rd6b4] White can retreat the queen to safety but black's lead in
development and safer king give good compensation.}) 11... dxc4 12. Bxc4 b5 13.
Bd3 (13. Bb3 {This is nothing special for white either.} Bb7) 13... Rd8 {
[%cal Gd8d2] There are a few pieces in between the queen and rook but it never
feels comfortable to have them opposite each other on an open file. White has
to spend another turn here to get out of harm's way.} 14. Qe2 Bb7 {Black is
now two tempi up in a symmetrical opening. Often symmetrical games can be very
drawish but Rubinstein finds a way to turn the small development advantage
into concrete problems for his opponent.} 15. O-O Ne5 $1 {[%cal Re5f3,Rb7f3]}
16. Nxe5 Bxe5 {[%csl Rd3,Rh2][%cal Re5h2,Re7d6,Rd6d3,Rd6h2] Now white is
provoked to create a kingside weakness.} 17. f4 $6 (17. Rfd1 {This was a
better way to keep the bishop defended on d3. White is behind in development,
so advancing the center and kingside pawns will only create more avenues for
the better developed black pieces to start operating on.}) 17... Bc7 $1 {
[%cal Gc7b6]} 18. e4 Rac8 19. e5 Bb6+ {[%cal Gb6g1,Gb7g2] These bishops are
lasers with their sights pointed at the white king.} 20. Kh1 Ng4 $1 {[%cal
Ye2g4,Yd8d3] Perfect timing! With black having achieved complete development,
now is absolutely the time to strike with some kind of active and forceful
advance against the white position. Black does not want to waste time with
non-confrontational plans and let white catch up.} (20... Nd5 $2 21. Nxd5 Bxd5
22. Rac1 $17 {Black is still better here but not anywhere near as much as in
the game.}) 21. Be4 (21. Qxg4 {Unfortunately, this does not save white.} Rxd3 {
[%csl Gb7][%cal Rd3c3,Rd3d2,Rd2g2,Rd2b2,Gb7g2] By removing white's
light-squared bishop, there is no hope of stopping the bishop on b7.}) 21...
Qh4 $1 {[%cal Rh4h2] In order to play this move, Rubinstein would have needed
to have calculated the entire game continuation in advance. Without doing that
there would be no way of knowing that all of these loose pieces black will be
ok.} 22. g3 {[%csl Rc3][%cal Yc3e4,Ye2e4]} (22. h3 {This doesn't work either.}
Rxc3 $1 {With shades of the game.} 23. Bxc3 Bxe4 24. Qxe4 Qg3) 22... Rxc3 $3 {
[%cal Ye2e4]} 23. gxh4 {[%cal Ye2e4,Gb7e4]} Rd2 $3 {[%csl Re2][%cal Ye2e4,
Gb7e4,Rd2e2]} 24. Qxd2 Bxe4+ {[%csl Rb6,Re4][%cal Rb6g1,Re4h1]} 25. Qg2 {
[%csl Gh2][%cal Re4h1,Rb6g1]} Rh3 $1 {[%cal Rh3h2,Re4h1,Rb6g1] A calm and
quiet crushing move. If anyone is looking for an example of how powerful a
bishop pair can be, looking no further.} 0-1
