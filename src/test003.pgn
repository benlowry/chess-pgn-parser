1. e4 (1. d4 d5 (1... e5 $2 {This is the Englund Gambit. Not to be recommended,
although there is a dangerous trick which players with Black here are usually
aiming for.} 2. dxe5 Nc6 3. Nf3 Qe7 4. Bf4 {[%csl Rb2,Re1,Rf4]} Qb4+ 5. Bd2
Qxb2 {[%csl Ra1][%cal Rb2a1] This is the position that Black is aiming for.
White has to not take the bait!} 6. Bc3 $4 {[%cal Rb4e1]} (6. Nc3 $1 {With a
huge development advantage and much better position.}) 6... Bb4 $1 7. Qd2 (7.
Bxb4 {This is no good because of the following} Nxb4 {The knight fork on c2
will be too powerful.}) 7... Bxc3 8. Qxc3 {It might look like white has
everything covered here but...} Qc1# {Oops!}) 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5
{This is a very common variation known as the Exchange Variation.} 5. Bg5 {
White typically likes to go here to apply pressure along the diagonal and
undermine control over the d5-square. However, Black has a chance to set a
trap here that does not compromise their position.} Nbd7 {[%csl Rd7,Yd8][%cal
Yd8d5]} 6. Nxd5 $4 Nxd5 $1 7. Bxd8 {[%csl Re1]} Bb4+ $1 8. Qd2 Bxd2+ 9. Kxd2
Kxd8 {Black has emerged with an extra Knight for only a pawn and is in good
shape to go on to win the game.}) 1... e5 (1... c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 {Offering
the Smith-Morra gambit. Black has many ways to respond but can find themself
in a difficult situation after following this very natural continuation.} dxc3 
4. Nxc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 d6 6. Bc4 {[%csl Rf7][%cal Rc4f7]} Nf6 $6  7. e5 $1 
{As a younger player I remember sitting next to several players who played 
this way with White and never quite understood what they were up to. You will 
soon see!} dxe5 $2  {[%csl Rf7] Not as bad as 7... Nxe5 but Black is still 
worse off here, and there is potential for a major disaster to happen.}  (7... 
Ng4 $1 {Is playable and leads to an unclear position}) (7... Nxe5 $4 {This 
completely backfires for Black. They will not be able to recapture without 
losing their queen.} 8. Nxe5 dxe5 $4 {[%csl Rd8][%cal Re8d8,Gd1d8]} 9. Bxf7+ 
Kxf7 10. Qxd8) 8. Qxd8+ $1 Nxd8 {This leads to the most spectacular variation of the trap!} (
8... Kxd8 9. Ng5 $1 {Black needs to find the stubborn} Na5 {in order to stay
in the game.}) 9. Nb5 $1 {[%cal Rc7a8,Rc7e8]} Kd7 $4 {Trying to defend the
fork on c7 but this is a massive mistake...} 10. Nxe5+ Ke8 11. Nc7# {Ouch!}) 2.
Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 (3. Bb5 Nf6 {Kramnik famously used this opening with great
success in his World Championship match with Kasparov, helping him to
eventually dethrone one of the greatest players of all time. This solid
opening is not usually known for tricks and traps and perhaps for that reason
your opponent may not suspect anything after the following moves...} 4. d3 Ne7
$5 {[%csl Ge5][%cal Gf3e5] An audacious move. Completely breaking the rules of
the opening but it's not as pointless as it originally appears. The knight is
heading to g6 in order to defend the e5-pawn and Black will soon play c6 to
gain some control over the center.} 5. Nxe5 $4 c6 $1 6. Bc4 {[%csl Re1,Re5]}
Qa5+ {This was Black's idea, winning the knight on e5}) 3... Nd4 {This trap is
very common because it has a good chance of working! Even Josh Waitzkin,
legendary hero of the movie "Searching for Bobby Fischer" fell for this trap
in one of his youth tournaments. If Josh can fall for it, anyone can!} 4. Nxe5
$2 {[%csl Re5,Rg2] This unsuspecting move is a costly mistake, allowing Black
a double attack.} (4. Nxd4 $1 exd4 5. O-O {With an advantage}) 4... Qg5 $1 5.
Nxf7 $4 {[%cal Rf7g5,Rf7h8] After this natural move though, there is no
turning back. White went from worse to completely losing with this move.} Qxg2
$1 {[%csl Rh1][%cal Rg2h1]} 6. Rf1 Qxe4+ 7. Be2 {[%cal Ye4e1]} (7. Qe2 Nxe2 {
Black is winning}) 7... Nf3# {[%csl Re1] An unforgettable checkmate.} *
