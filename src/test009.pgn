{Going into this game the match was 9-8 in a race to 10 wins. Steinitz, the
reigning champion was ahead. All he needed was one more win but for Mikhail
Chigorin, a win would bring him even in the match with only one win needed to
become world champion. I use this game as a lesson to show what can happen if
you let your nerves get to you when you're playing. There are a lot of high
stress moments in tournaments and else where. It's best to try to calm
yourself down before making any hasty choices...} 1. e4 e5 2. f4 $5 {It's rare
I punctuate the second move of a game but the King's Gambit is seen so rarely
nowadays that even this second move of the game is noteworthy. It's not
necessarily a bad opening for white but it is thought that black is not
challenged here as much as other options for white. Steinitz chooses a defense
that is well respected even today.} exf4 {[%cal Rd8h4]} (2... d5) 3. Nf3 {

Be2 g6 $1 {This is actually a very clever setup by Steinitz. His knight is
secure on h5 and the dark-squared bishop will come to g7. In combination with
d7-d6 black will put a lot of pressure on the white center.} 6. d4 Bg7 7. O-O {

special after this move, it would be best to eliminate the annoying pressure
black is building up against the e5-pawn.}) 8... O-O 9. Ne1 $5 {[%cal Re2h5]}

version for white than what happens in the game. With the knight on c3 white
definitely has better coordination and activity.}) 10... gxh5 $17 11. dxe5 {

It's simple and strong here.}) 14. Ne3 Be4 15. Nf3 Rfe8 16. Ng5 Bg6 {[%cal
Rc6e5,Re8e5,Rg7e5,Yg6c2,Yg7b2]} 17. Nd5 {White can't defend the e5-pawn so
this counterattack makes a lot of sense. Chigorin needs something to make up
for black's strong bishop pair and loss of center pawn.} Bxe5 $1 18. Nxc7 Bxc7
19. Bxc7 Rac8 20. Bg3 Nd4 $1 21. c3 $6 Ne2+ $1 {This is a correct decision but
Steinitz wasn't able to follow up correctly.} 22. Kf2 {[%csl Re2]} h4 $2 $14 {
A huge swing! Now white is back in the driver's seat. Black's knight is going
to end up short of squares on e2.} (22... Nxg3 $1 $17 {Black is close to
winning if they play this move!} 23. hxg3 {[%csl Rb2,Rg5]} Re5 $1 24. Nf3 Rb5 {
[%csl Yb1][%cal Gb5b2,Yg6b1] White has no good way to defend the pawn. b3 will
hang the pawn on c3 and b1 is covered by the black bishop.}) (22... Bd3 23.

the emotions that both players must have been feeling at this time but it's
hard to justify this move. I have a sense that Steinitz was either in time
pressure or his emotions were clouding his judgment. This sacrifice is
definitely not correct and costs black valuable material.} 24. cxd4 {[%cal

king back on the 8th rank but it's completely hopeless there.} Kf6 (29... Kg8

accurate move. Black has threats like Bh5-f3+ with a back rank mate getting
set up. White also needs to deal with the pressure on the d5-pawn.} 32. Bb4 $4
{[%csl Rh2] Yikes! Anything but this! Unfortunately, there is no second
chances after this move. It's hard to explain such a move but it is definitely
one of the worst mistakes in chess history.} (32. Rxb7 $1 {This move saves the
