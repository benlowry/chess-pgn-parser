{Can this be called the most famous game ever played? Maybe. With the netlfix
shows popularity this may actually the most massively seen chess game in
history. It's certainly a great game and finale to the show.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4

spectacular move nearly buries the white queenside on the queenside.} 9. Qxa5

7... c6 $1 (7... Bd7 {Although this works after 7. Nf3 and 8. Qa4+, it is not
as good of an option now.} 8. Qxa5 a6 9. Nb1 $14) 8. dxc6 Nxc6 9. Bxc4 Bb4 10.
Nf3 Bd7 11. O-O {With an equal position.}) 7. Bxc4 Ng6 8. f3 Bd6 {White has a
solid space advantage but black is not too cramped and has a relatively
comfortable position.} 9. Qd2 Bd7 10. Nge2 a6 11. Bb3 b5 12. a4 {[%cal Ga4b5,
Ga1a8] This is a common pawn lever against the a6+b5 pawn structure. White
controls when the a-file opens up.} O-O $1 (12... bxa4 $2 13. Bxa4 $16 {
Black's a-pawn in particular would be extremely weak here.}) 13. O-O Qe7 (13...
Nh5 {[%cal Yh5f4,Yd8g5] This plan was played on the next move but it's already
a good time for it here. If the knight makes it to f4, black may even consider
Qg5 after that.}) 14. Rac1 Nh5 15. g3 {[%csl Yg3][%cal Yg3f4]} h6 16. Bc2 Rab8
{It's hard for either side to make meaningful improvements at this point, so
there is a bit of a waiting game taking place now.} 17. axb5 axb5 18. Ra1 Ra8 (
18... Bh3 $5 19. Rf2 $1) 19. Bd3 Bb4 $6 {The bishop is not helpful here. The
pin is inconsequential.} (19... Rxa1 $1 20. Rxa1 {[%csl Gf3]} Qf6 {[%csl Rf3]
[%cal Rf6f3] The computer recommends this idea with pressure against the
f-pawn. A person would hesitate to do this because it blocks black's f-pawn,
preventing a natural pawn break that black may want to use.}) 20. Rxa8 Rxa8 21.

preparing to open the file or even expand further with f5-f4 at the right
moment.} 28. Nc5 Bc8 29. Rf1 $2 {[%cal Yg6f4,Yg6h4,Yg3f4,Yg3h4]} (29. Qe2 Rb8)
29... Ne7 (29... Nf8 $1 {[%cal Gf8h7,Gh7f6] Black would like to bring the
knight to f6 in order to pressure the e4 pawn and set up moves like Ng4 at an
ideal moment.}) 30. Qd3 fxe4 31. fxe4 Qg6 $6 (31... Kh7 $1 {[%cal Ge7g8,Gg8f6]
Once again the idea of preparing the knight to go to f6 was powerful. We can
see here that without white's pawn on f3, black's knight on f6 will be a great
piece. It threatens e4 but also Nf6-g4 with pressure against h2 and e3.}) 32.
Kg2 Kh7 33. Nf3 Ng8 34. Nh4 (34. h3 $5 Bxc5 35. Bxc5 Nf6 $15) 34... Qg4 35. Nf5
Nf6 $2 {Mistake. Ra2 was best.} (35... Ra2 $1 {[%cal Ra2g2] This would have
been strong. The rook certainly belongs on the second rank. It's a natural
move with plenty of targets.} 36. Qb1 {Perhaps black was concerned about this.}
Qe2+ $1 37. Rf2 Qc4 $15 {This keeps black's pieced connected and white's
pieces tied down.}) 36. h3 {In the show the game was adjourned here and had
actually been following a game played in 1993 at the Biel Interzonal between
Ivanchuk and Wolff. Interestingly Ivanchuk's first name is Vassily and Wolff
is an American GM, so the roles have been reversed!} Qg6 37. Ne6 Ra4 38. b3
Rxe4 39. Nxd6 Bxe6 40. dxe6 cxd6 41. e7 d5 {At this point in the show it is
clear that this is not a move that Beth anticipated in her home analysis.
She's caught off guard but it sets up the situation in a way that both players
are able to play freely from here with no preparation, letting the best player
win.} 42. Bc5 {[%cal Gc5e7,Gb3b4]} Qe8 43. Qf3 Qc6 44. b4 Qe8 $4 {Upon playing
this move, Borgov says "Draw?" The commentators of the game point out that if
Beth accepts, she will be tying the World Champion and that it would be a
great result. They also remak that Borgov is deadly in endgames, however Beth
correctly decides to play on. As it turns out, Qe8 is actually a losing move.
Now Beth finds the accurate continuation...} (44... Kh8 {Something not too
committal like this would have been a better option. There isn't much black
can do to improve their position, but in any case it would be helpful to avoid
checks on the f5 square.}) 45. Qf5+ Kh8 {[%csl Rf8]} (45... Kg8 46. Qe6+ Qf7
47. e8=Q+ {wins immediately.} (47. Rxf6 {This also wins immediately.})) 46.
Qxf6 $1 gxf6 47. Rxf6 {[%csl Rf8][%cal Rf6f8,Rf8e8,Rf8h8] The queen on e8 is
very misplaced. It's now a target for Rf8+. Borgov tries to create some
complications but Beth has everything covered.} Qh5 48. Rf8+ Kg7 49. e8=Q {
Commentator: "That check has been the whole point of the sequence. Beginning
with the bishop, cutting down the scope of the rook by forcing it to a less
threatening rank. The question is: what will she do now?"} Re2+ {Inaccuracy.
Qxe8 was best.} 50. Kf1 Qxh3+ {Checkmate is now unavoidable. Qxe8 was best.} (
50... Qxe8 51. Rxe8 $18 {White will win the endgame.}) 51. Kxe2 Qg2+ 52. Rf2
Qe4+ 53. Kd2 {[%csl Yd4,Ye3,Yf4][%cal Yf2f4,Yc5e3,Yg3f4] Out of checks and out
of luck, Borgov picks up his king and graciously says "It's your game" holds
the king out farther and says "Take it". Needless to say Beth is quite the
hero after winning the game.} 1-0
